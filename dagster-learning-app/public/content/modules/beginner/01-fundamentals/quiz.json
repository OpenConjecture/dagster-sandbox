      "explanation": "Assets are the core building blocks in Dagster. They represent the data and ML models you want to exist in your system."

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "In Dagster, you define HOW to compute data assets, not WHAT assets should exist.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "points": 10,
      "explanation": "This is false. Dagster takes an asset-centric approach where you define WHAT data assets should exist, and Dagster handles the orchestration of HOW to compute them."

      "points": 20,
      "explanation": "You need to import 'asset' from dagster and use the @asset decorator to define an asset."

      "explanation": "While Dagster can scale, automatic scaling to 1000+ nodes isn't a built-in feature. The other options are core features of Dagster."
