## Quick Start Guide

### For Small Teams (< 1GB total daily data)
```python
from dagster import Definitions, FilesystemIOManager

# Start simple with filesystem storage
Definitions(
    assets=your_assets,
    resources={
        "io_manager": FilesystemIOManager(base_dir="./data")
    }
)
```
**Expected Overhead**: < 5% of execution time
**Infrastructure**: Single node, 4-8GB RAM

### For Medium Teams (1-100GB daily data)
```python
from dagster import Definitions
from custom_io import ParquetIOManager  # See implementation guide

# Optimize with format-specific storage
Definitions(
    assets=your_assets,
    resources={
        "io_manager": ParquetIOManager(
            base_path="s3://your-bucket/data",
            compression="snappy"
        )
    }
)
```
**Expected Overhead**: 5-15% of execution time  
**Infrastructure**: 8-16GB RAM, cloud storage

### For Large Teams (> 100GB daily data)
```python
from dagster import Definitions
from custom_io import ReferenceIOManager, WarehouseResource

# Use warehouse-native processing
Definitions(
    assets=your_assets,
    resources={
        "io_manager": ReferenceIOManager(),
        "warehouse": WarehouseResource(connection="your_warehouse")
    }
)
```
**Expected Overhead**: < 1% of execution time (orchestration only)  
**Infrastructure**: Minimal Dagster resources, leverage warehouse compute

## Decision Framework

### I/O Manager Selection

| Data Size | Frequency | Distribution | Recommended Approach | Estimated Overhead |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| < 10MB | Any | Single node | Default FilesystemIOManager | Minimal |
| 10-100MB | < 10x/day | Single node | Default FilesystemIOManager | Low |
| 10-100MB | > 10x/day | Single/Multi-node | Custom ParquetIOManager | Medium |
| 100MB-1GB | < 5x/day | Multi-node | Cloud pickle I/O manager | High |
| 100MB-1GB | > 5x/day | Multi-node | Custom format-specific | Variable |
| > 1GB | Any | Any | Reference pattern | Minimal |

## Common Patterns Summary

### Pattern 1: Default for Development
- **Use Case**: Rapid prototyping, development environments
- **Implementation**: FilesystemIOManager with local storage
- **Overhead**: Minimal
- **Scalability**: Single node only

### Pattern 2: Cloud Production
- **Use Case**: Multi-node production with moderate data volumes

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Memory Issues
- **Symptom**: Out of memory during asset materialization
- **Solutions**: Reduce concurrency, implement streaming I/O, use reference patterns
- **Prevention**: Memory planning calculations, monitoring

### Network Timeouts
